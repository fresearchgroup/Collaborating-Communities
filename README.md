## Welcome to the Repository For Collaborating Communities !

Let's Collaborate !
The idea of working together to achieve something great. Collaboration has always gathered people together and share ideas and contribute.
Our system is built by integrating this idea of collaboration where people create , edit , review and publish OERs in the form of audios, videos, images, texts, manuscripts, books, and such other digital assets and together they  contribute to our Drupal 7.
 
Five major components of the system we have developed are :
1. Content Publishing Workflow (Create, Edit, Review and Publish)
2. Localization support for Indian languages (Content Translation)
3. User Reputation Model (Points based Model)
4. Content versioning (Stores Revision of Content)
5. Content Categorization ( Create Communities of Content )
6. Search
 
We have a long way to go and we keep searching for developers and testers . Every contribution is of immense value. We plan on adding components like recommendation system , etc and integrating drupal with DSpace. 


**Get our code**
Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/fresearchgroup/Collaborating-Communities.git`

**Import our Database file**
Drupal stores its configuration info in the database. There is a SQL file with every release (none yet), import it to your drupal database.
Create a database for drupal. For a MySql database import the sql file with the following command or use phpMyAdmin.

`cd [drupal root]`
`mysql -u [sql_username] -p [drupal database name] < /path/to/file/database.sql`
